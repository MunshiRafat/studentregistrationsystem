Student Registration System is a web based application built with php and mysql database for students to register in a course in a particular semester of the university and view and edit their details. An administrator of the system can retrieve data about all students in the course semesters and view and update any student details as well as remove student/s from the system database.

Find all the details in the SRS file and SDD file which you would find here.

For this project you need xampp installed in your pc. Paste all the files and folders in your C:\xampp\htdocs\student folder and in phpmyadmin page of your localhost, create a database with the details provided in the screen shots which you will find here.

Implement it and view all the requirements which are present in the SRS being met and you can then customise as per your needs :)
